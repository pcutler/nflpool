NFLPool Installation and Requirements
#####################################

NFLPool Requirements
####################

NFLPool requires Python 3.6 or higher, Pyramid 1.9 and SQLite.  You will know how to use the Pyramid web framework, visit the `Pyramid documentation`_ to learn more.

NFLPool uses the following Python modules:

- Passlib (for hashing user passwords)
- Pendulum (for date and datetime management)
- Pyramid Handlers
- Pytest (for testing)
- Requests
- Rollbar (for error reporting)
- Sphinx (for documentation)
- SQLAlchemy (database ORM)

Third Party Requirements
########################

NFPool requires the use of four third party services including `MySportsFeeds`_ for NFL statistics,
`Mailjet`_ (or Amazon SES) for email integration for user registration and password resets,
`Rollbar`_ for application error reporting, and `Slack`_ for administrative messaging.

MySportsFeeds
-------------

`MySportsFeeds`_ offers competitive pricing for commercial customers for sports statistics including the NFL, NHL,
NBA and MLB.  MySportsFeeds also offers free use for developers and non-commercial customers for past seasons, and a
`Patreon`_ for as low as $1 / month for post-game statistics (which is the minimum you will need for NFLPool).  You
will need to contact `MySportsFeeds`_ to finish creating an account from the "Contact Us" page on their website.

Email
-----

You will need a third party service to integrate email into NFLPool.  Email integration is required for user
registration and password resets.  NFLPool currently uses `Mailjet`_ and could be replaced by
`Amazon Simple Email Service`_ which is covered later in installation.


Error Reporting with Rollbar
----------------------------

`Rollbar`_ is used for error reporting.  Visit the `Rollbar`_ website to create and account and obtain your API key.
If you are using Github, you can link it with your Github repository and Rollbar will automatically create a new
issue for you in your Github repo when an error is reported.  Rollbar can also be integrated with Slack to message
you with errors.  Both email and / or Slack are helpful in case your application has an error or crashes.

Slack
-----

`Slack`_ is used via a bot that messages your Slack channel when a new user registers or submits their picks for
the season. You will need to create a `Slack app`_ with an incoming webhook and the webhook URL.

If you don't want to use Slack, it should be fairly simple to remove the feature, which is covered later in the
installation documentation.

Application Installation
------------------------

1.  Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.

2.  Clone the NFLPool git repository

3.  Install the needed Python packages using pip in your virtual environment:  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

4. Run setup.py to install it, including registering ``nflpool`` as a module (you may encounter an error in Pyramid if you don't do this):  ``python setup.py develop``

5. Start the Pyramid server, usually done with ``pserve``.

.. note:: Installing a Python virtual environment and starting the Pyramid application are out of scope for NFLPool documentation.  Visit the `Pyramid documentation`_ for more information.


Installation
############

You will need to rename three files.  In the root of your Pyramid application, rename ``development-example.ini``
and ``production-example.ini`` to ``development.ini`` and ``production.ini``.  In the ``data`` directory rename
``secret-config.py`` to ``secret.py``.

Pyramid Configuration
---------------------

In the ``development.ini`` and ``production.ini`` you will need to:

- Set the mode (``dev`` or ``prod``).  Dev mode will disable emails from sending.

- Mail server: Depending if you're using Mailjet or Amazon SES, enter your username, password, server and port information for your email service.

- Logging settings: Enter the name of the logfile you wish to create and the relative path.  By default, the logfile is saved in the root directory of your Pyramid application.

- Rollbar: Enter your Rollbar API token, the environment (dev or prod) and if using Git, which branch (default is master).

Application Configuration
-------------------------

.. note::  MySportsFeeds offers two versions of it's API: 1.2 (legacy) and 2.0 (current).  1.2 uses HTTPAuth Basic for user authentication and 2.0 uses token based authentication.  NFLPool as of the 2.0 release (October 2018) now uses MySportsFeeds version 2.0 API.

In the ``data`` directory, configure your application settings in ``secret.py``.

Enter your MySportsFeeds credentials:

For version 2.0 of the MySportsFeeds API you will need to log into the MySportsFeeds website, create a token with support for their NFL feeds.  Enter the credentials here:

msf_api = "YOUR API KEY / TOKEN"

msf_v2pw = "MYSPORTSFEEDS"

And finally:

- su_email = 'administrator email address'

- slack_webhook_url = 'your Slack webhook URL'

To disable Slack, comment out the ``slack_webhook_url``.  In the ``controllers`` directory, comment out
all methods of ``message`` and ``SlackService`` in the ``account_controller.py`` and ``picks_controller.py`` files.

Database Creation
-----------------

Make sure a ``db`` directory has been created in the ``nflpool/nflpool`` directory of your Pyramid application.
This is where the SQLite database will be created.
