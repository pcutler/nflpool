Welcome to NFLPool's documentation!
===================================

NFLPool is a fantasy football like league.  Unlike fantasy football, where you need to draft a team and
manage your lineup on a weekly basis, in NFLPool, before the season starts, you will pick teams and
players and where you think they will finish over the course of the National Football League season.
You do not need to set any weekly lineups.  Standings and statistics are updated weekly and you just sit back
and watch the standings every weekly to see if your picks are correct.
