Welcome to NFLPool's documentation!
===================================

NFLPool is a fantasy football like league.  Unlike fantasy football, where you need to draft a team and
manage your lineup on a weekly basis, in NFLPool before the NFL season starts, you will pick where you think teams
will finish in their divisions and a player you think will be a leader in a given statistical category.
No weekly lineups, no micromanaging your team.  Once the NFL season kicks off, your picks are locked.
Standings and statistics are updated weekly and you just sit back and watch the standings every week to hope
and see if your picks are correct.
